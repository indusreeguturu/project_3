    <h2>Who are Serial Killers?</h2>
    <p>By definition: A person who commits a series of murders, often with no apparent motive and typically following a characteristic, predictable behavior pattern. However, I believe they do have a motive and have an M.O. too</p>
    <p>Motives are majorly either Money, Sex or psychological disorder. They are Psychopaths or Sociopaths who lack empathy or sympathy towards other human beings.</p>
    <h2>Psychopaths</h2>
    <p>A person affected by chronic mental disorder with abnormal or violent social behavior.</p>
    <h2>Sociopath</h2>
    <p>A person with a personality disorder manifesting itself in extreme antisocial attitudes and behavior and a lack of conscience.</p>
    <h2>World's Most notorious Serial Killer- H.H.Holmes</h2>
    <p>Dr. Henry Howard Holmes or H. H. Holmes, was an American con artist and serial killer. During the late 1800s, he has designed a 'Murder Castle' which was abode to many human experiments and murders.</p>
    <p>Various subjects like how long can human be elongated?How much can a person be compressed? How long can a human survive without food? etc have been picked by him and he conducted experiments on people, mostly young blonde women in their 20s who have checked into his hotel.There is even a book which was written on him "Devil in the White city"</p>
    <p>It was the time of the Great Exhibition in Chicago and hence, young people from all parts of the world travelled to Chicago to attend the World Fair. It was easy for H.H.Holmes to prey on unassuming and vulnerable travellers.</p>
