      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>If you ask me, cooking is an artform.It requires lots of patience to make food. We can try various cultures and learn about traditions from all over the world by understanding that place's taste palette. I make amazing Biryani which is one of the most famous regional foods in India, the place I hail from.</p>

      <h2>Puzzles</h2>
      <p>Puzzles are the best pastime ever. Solving puzzles, be it jigsaw or logical, will sharpen your skills and make you think more. If they are mystery puzzles like in escape rooms, they are amazing group activities for team building too. I have over a dozen jigsaw puzzles and I solve them whenever I feel unfocused.</p>
